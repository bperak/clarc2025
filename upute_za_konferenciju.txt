## About CLARC2025

The Center for Language Research at the University of Rijeka proudly presents CLARC2025, a groundbreaking international conference at the intersection of linguistics and artificial intelligence.

In an era where technological achievements are reshaping reality, language‚Äîthe foundation of human communication, culture, and identity‚Äîis no longer solely the domain of philological research. It has evolved into a field of intensive collaboration with information technologies. 

Artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analysis, and natural language processing (NLP) have become essential tools in language study, offering new possibilities for analyzing, processing, and preserving linguistic data. From automatic speech recognition and machine translation to social media analysis, semantic search, and digital language preservation‚Äîlinguistic and information sciences are becoming allies in creating smarter, more accessible technologies.

**CLARC2025** invites you to join us in creating the future of digital linguistics!
