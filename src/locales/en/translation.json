In this era of technological transformation, language research has evolved into a field of intensive collaboration with information technologies. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analysis, and natural language processing (NLP) have become essential tools in language study, offering new possibilities for analyzing, processing, and preserving linguistic data. From speech recognition and machine translation to social media analysis and digital language preservation—linguistic and information sciences are becoming allies in creating smarter, more accessible technologies. Join us in creating the future of digital linguistics!",
